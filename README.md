# TNClick

You're an engineering school student and ended up partying all the semester, until the exam week. ðŸ¥´\
However, as a soon-to-be engineer, you surely can find a solution for this problem.


## Release

Game is available online on Itch.io at https://baldraven.itch.io/tnclick 

It's also possible to play directly the game natively on your machine, by downloading [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) and running the game's source code with it.

## About

TNClick is a point-and-click adventure game, made in october 2021 for a school CTF (which had both cybersecurity and video game challenges). It was adapted from another game I made during 2021 summer, using the Lua framework [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/).

Disclaimer : it's in french and has a lot of private jokes made for the students of the school.
