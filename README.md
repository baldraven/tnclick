## TNClick

You're an engineering school student and ended up partying all the semester, until the exam week.ðŸ¥´\
However, as a soon-to-be engineer, you surely can find a solution for this problem.

TNClick is a point-and-click adventure game, made in october 2021 for a school CTF (which had both cybersecurity and video game challenges). It was adapted from another game I made during 2021 summer.
Disclaimer : it's in french and has a lot of private jokes made for the students of the school.
